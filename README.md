# Madnopoly-Board-Generator
Madnopoly is a hybrid digital–analog Monopoly-style system that procedurally generates a single continuous board path on a grid and assigns playable tiles using seeded randomness. Each generated board is exported as JSON to drive a digital interface which is recreated onto a  physical, real-world game board.
